       <b>For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing,<br>
        neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten.</b><br>
        <strong>— Ecclesiastes 9:5</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        For in death there is no remembrance of thee:<br>
        in the grave who shall give thee thanks?<br>
        <strong>— Psalm 6:5</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David,<br>
        that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day.<br>
        For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith himself,<br>
        “The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand.”<br>
        <strong>— Acts 2:29, 34</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        For the grave cannot praise thee, death cannot celebrate thee:<br>
        they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth.<br>
        <strong>— Isaiah 38:18</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep,<br>
        that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.<br>
        For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus<br>
        will God bring with him.<br>
        For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain<br>
        unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.<br>
        For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout,<br>
        with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God:<br>
        and the dead in Christ shall rise first:<br>
        Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds,<br>
        to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.<br>
        <strong>— 1 Thessalonians 4:13–17</strong>
